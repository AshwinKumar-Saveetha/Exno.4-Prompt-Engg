### REGISTER NUMBER : 212223040021
### Aim: Scenario-Based Report Development Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques
### Algorithm:  The goal of this experiment is to design and develop an AI-powered chatbot that can handle customer inquiries, provide support, and improve customer experience in a retail environment. Create prompts using various AI prompting techniques to guide your experiment, data collection, analysis, and report creation

### Prompting Techniques by Stage
#### 1. Experiment Design
Broad/Naïve Prompting:

“What services should a retail chatbot offer?”

Specific Prompting:

“Name 5 customer support features for an e-commerce chatbot.”

Scenario-Based Prompting:

“Imagine a customer looking for a late delivery update. How should the chatbot respond?”

2. Data Collection
Role Prompting:

“You are a frustrated customer—ask about your order.”

Few-Shot Prompting:

Provide short back-and-forth sample conversations for data synthesis.

Survey Prompts:

“Rate your experience from 1-10.”

Follow-Up Prompts:

“If the chatbot didn’t help, what went wrong?”

3. Model Training
Instruction Prompting:

“Classify queries into: Order Status, Product Info, Complaints.”

Chain-of-Thought Prompting:

Step-by-step handling of complaints (e.g., ask for ID, check eligibility, respond).

Zero-Shot Prompting:

Classify unseen queries without examples to test generalization.

4. Evaluation & Analysis
Reflexive Prompting:

Ask the AI to critique its own response and offer a better one.

Comparative Prompting:

“Compare chatbot accuracy before and after fine-tuning.”

Data Synthesis Prompts:

“List top features users requested.”

5. Report Creation
Persona Prompting:

“Explain performance findings to retail managers in simple terms.”

Summary Prompting:

“Summarize key issues users faced with the chatbot.”

Recommendation Prompting:

“Based on feedback, suggest 3 improvements.”

Experiment Workflow Table:

Stage	Prompt Type	Purpose
Scenario Design	Role, Scenario, Few-Shot	Build realistic conversations
Data Collection	Survey, Follow-Up	Capture user needs and chatbot limitations
Model Training	Instruction, Chain-of-Thought	Improve intent handling and task flow
Evaluation	Zero-Shot, Reflexive	Assess performance on new queries and self-review
Report Generation	Persona, Comparative	Present results to stakeholders and improve design
Findings:
User Needs Identified
Prompt Techniques Effectiveness
Chatbot Accuracy, Relevance, and Response Time

# Result: Thus the Prompts were exected succcessfully .
